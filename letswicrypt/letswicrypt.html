    </center>
    <br><br>


    <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>


    Prolog is extremely well suited for writing
    <a href="/prolog/web"><b>web&nbsp;applications</b></a>.

    <br><br>

    This document explains how to set up and run secure
    (<b>HTTPS</b>) web&nbsp;servers using SWI-Prolog with
    <i>Let's&nbsp;Encrypt</i> and other certificate authorities.

    <br><br>

    You can download all files from a public git
    repository: <a href="https://github.com/triska/letswicrypt">https://github.com/triska/letswicrypt</a>

    <br><br>

    SWI-Prolog <b>7.5.8</b> or later ships with everything that is
    necessary to run HTTPS&nbsp;servers as described in the following.

    <center><h2>Obtaining a certificate</h2></center>

    For the sake of concreteness, assume that we want to set up an
    HTTPS&nbsp;server that is reachable at <tt>xyz.com</tt> and
    <tt>www.xyz.com</tt>. These names are chosen also because they are easy to
    search for and do not occur anywhere else in the configuration files.

    <center><h3>Variant A: Use <i>Let's Encrypt</i></h3></center>

    <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><b>Let's Encrypt</b></a> is a
    free certificate authority&nbsp;(CA).

    <br><br>

    The tool is easy to install and run. Follow the instructions on their
    page, and then execute the following command on the host machine:

    <pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d xyz.com -d www.xyz.com
    </pre>

    <b>Note</b>: This requires that you <i>stop</i> any server that listens on
    port&nbsp;80 or port&nbsp;443, until the certificate is obtained. There
    are also other ways to obtain a certificate that allow you to keep
        existing servers running. See below for more information.

    <br><br>

    After this is completed, you obtain 4 files
    in <tt>/etc/letsencrypt/live/xyz.com/</tt>:

    <pre>
/etc/letsencrypt/live/xyz.com/cert.pem
/etc/letsencrypt/live/xyz.com/chain.pem
/etc/letsencrypt/live/xyz.com/fullchain.pem
/etc/letsencrypt/live/xyz.com/privkey.pem
    </pre>

    We only need two of them:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>privkey.pem</tt>: the server's private key</li>
      <li><tt>fullchain.pem</tt>: the certificate and certificate chain.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <center><h3>Variant B: Use a different certificate authority</h3></center>

    You can also use a different CA. To do that, you first create a
    new private key and certificate signing request&nbsp;(CSR). The
    file [openssl.cnf](openssl.cnf) shows you what is necessary to
    create a&nbsp;CSR for both <tt>xyz.com</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>www.xyz.com</tt>. The
    <tt>alt_names</tt>&nbsp;section is relevant to cover both domains:

    <pre>
[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = www.xyz.com
DNS.2 = xyz.com
    </pre>

    Using&nbsp;<tt>openssl.cnf</tt>, you can create the key&nbsp;(<tt>server.key</tt>)
    and CSR&nbsp;(<tt>server.csr</tt>) for example with:

    <pre>
$ openssl req -out server.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -config openssl.cnf
    </pre>

    You can inspect the created CSR with:

    <pre>
$ openssl req -text -noout -verify -in server.csr
    </pre>

    To obtain a certificate, you have again two options: Either use a
    trusted&nbsp;CA (simply supply&nbsp;<tt>server.csr</tt>), or self-sign the
    key using for example:

    <pre>
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt -extensions v3_req -extfile openssl.cnf
    </pre>

    In both cases, the files that are important for the following are:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>server.key</tt>: the server's private key</li>
      <li><tt>server.crt</tt>: the certificate and certificate chain.</li>
    </ul>

    Note that&mdash;up to naming&mdash;this corresponds to the files
    obtained in Variant&nbsp;A.

    <center><h2>Running an HTTPS server with SWI-Prolog</h2></center>

    In the previous section, we have seen two ways to obtain a private key
    and a certificate. For clarity, we have used different file names to
    distinguish the variants. We now assume the following files are
    available in <tt>/var/www/xyz.com/</tt>, no matter which variant you used to
    obtain them:

    <ol>
      <li><tt>server.key</tt>: the server's private key</li>
      <li><tt>server.crt</tt>: the certificate and certificate chain.</li>
    </ol>

    <b>Note</b>: You can store the certificate and&nbsp;key in any
    location, and also <i>leave</i> the files
    in <tt>/etc/letsencrypt/live/</tt> if you used
    <i>Let's&nbsp;Encrypt</i> to obtain them. This is because
    SWI-Prolog reads these files <i>before</i> dropping privileges when
    starting an HTTPS&nbsp;server.

    <br><br>

    As the name suggests, the private key is meant to be kept
    <i>private</i>. Therefore, make sure to use suitable file
    permissions.

    <br><br>

    You can inspect the issued certificate with:

    <pre>
$ openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout
    </pre>

    <center><h2>Preliminaries: SWI-Prolog web server as Unix daemon</h2></center>

    The file <a href="server.pl"><tt>server.pl</tt></a> contains a very simple web server that
    is written using SWI-Prolog. In its current form, it simply replies
    with&nbsp;<tt>Hello!</tt> to any request. In a more realistic scenario, you
    would of course supply a more suitable definition
    of&nbsp;<tt>handle_request/1</tt>, so that the server replies with more
    useful content. Still, this basic server suffices to illustrate the
    principle for running an HTTPS&nbsp;server with any of the
    certificates we obtained in the previous steps.

    <br><br>

    First, note that this server uses
    the <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc/_SWI_/library/http/http_unix_daemon.pl"><tt>http_unix_daemon</tt>
    library</a> This library makes it extremely easy to run the
    web&nbsp;server as a Unix&nbsp;daemon by implicitly augmenting the
    code to let you configure the server using command
    line&nbsp;options. If you have an existing web server that you
    want to turn into a Unix daemon, simply add the following
    directive at the beginning:

    <pre>
:- use_module(library(http/http_unix_daemon)).
    </pre>

    Once you have done this, you can run the server with:

    <pre>
$ swipl server.pl --port=PORT
    </pre>

    and it will automatically launch as a daemon process. During
    development, is is easier to work with the server on the terminal
    using an interactive Prolog&nbsp;toplevel, which you can enable with:

    <pre>
$ swipl server.pl --port=PORT <b>--interactive</b>
    </pre>

    where <tt>PORT</tt> is any free port on your system. Try for
    example&nbsp;<tt>--port=3041</tt>.

    <br><br>

    To find out more available command line options, use:

    <pre>
$ swipl server.pl --help
    </pre>

    <center><h2>Starting a Prolog HTTPS server</h2></center>

    To start an HTTPS server with SWI-Prolog, the following 3 command line
    options of the Unix daemon library are of particular relevance:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>--https</tt>: enables HTTPS, using port 443 by default.</li>
      <li><tt>--keyfile=FILE</tt>: <tt>FILE</tt> contains the server's private key.</li>
      <li><tt>--certfile=FILE</tt>: <tt>FILE</tt> contains the
        certificate and certificate chain.</li>
    </ul>

    So, in our case, we can launch the HTTPS server for example with:

    <pre>
      $ sudo swipl server.pl --https --user=you --keyfile=/var/www/xyz.com/server.key --certfile=/var/www/xyz.com/server.crt
    </pre>

    Note that running the server on port 443 requires root privileges. The
    <tt>--user</tt>&nbsp;option is necessary to drop privileges to the specified
    user after forking.

    <center><h2>Launching the HTTPS server on system startup</h2></center>

    To launch the HTTPS server on system startup, have a look at the
    <tt>systemd</tt> sample service
    file <a href="https.service"><tt>https.service</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    Adjust the file as necessary, copy it
    to <tt>/etc/systemd/system</tt> and enable it with

    <pre>
$ sudo systemctl enable /etc/systemd/system/https.service
    </pre>

    then start the service with:

    <pre>
$ sudo systemctl start https.service
    </pre>

    <center><h2>Making your server more secure</h2></center>

    Once your server is running, use for example
    <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/">SSL&nbsp;Labs</a> to assess
    the quality of its encryption settings.

    <br><br>

    As of 2018, it is possible to obtain an <b>A+</b> rating with
    SWI-Prolog HTTPS servers, by using:

    <ul>
      <li>as ciphers (see command line option <tt>--cipherlist</tt>): <tt>EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:EECDH+AES256:EDH+AES256:EECDH+CHACHA20:EDH+CHACHA20</tt></li>
      <li>the <tt>Strict-Transport-Security</tt> header field, to enable HSTS.</li>
    </ul>

    For additional security, you can encrypt the server's private key,
    using for example:

    <pre>
$ openssl rsa -des -in server.key -out server.enc
    </pre>

    To use an encrypted key when starting the server, use the
    <tt>--pwfile=FILE</tt> command line&nbsp;option of the HTTP Unix daemon,
    where <tt>FILE</tt> stores the password and has suitably restrictive access
    permissions.

    <center><h2>Renewing the certificate</h2></center>

    Once you have a web server running, you can use <i>Let's
    Encrypt</i> to obtain and <i>renew</i> your certificate <i>without
      stopping</i> the server.

    <br><br>

    To use this feature, you must configure your web server to serve any
    files located in the directory&nbsp;<b><tt>.well-known</tt></b>. With the
    SWI-Prolog HTTP&nbsp;infrastructure, you can do this by adding the
    following directives to your&nbsp;server:

    <pre>
:- use_module(library(http/http_files)).
:- http_handler(root('.well-known/'), http_reply_from_files('.well-known', []), [prefix]).
    </pre>

    Restart the server and use the <tt>--webroot</tt> option as in the following
    example:

    <pre>
$ sudo certbot certonly <b>--webroot</b> -w /var/www/xyz.com -d xyz.com -d www.xyz.com
    </pre>

    Please see <tt>man certbot</tt> for further options. For example, using
    <tt>--logs-dir</tt>, <tt>--config-dir</tt>
    and <tt>--work-dir</tt>, you can configure paths so that you can
    run <tt>certbot</tt> <i>without</i> root&nbsp;privileges. In the
    example above, it is assumed that your web content is located in
    the directory&nbsp;<tt>/var/www/xyz.com</tt>.

    <br><br>

    In this mode of operation, <i>Let's Encrypt</i> uses the existing web
    server and file contents to verify that you control the domain.

    <br><br>

    After you have done this, you can renew the certificate any time with:

    <pre>
$ certbot renew
    </pre>

    This automatically renews certificates that will expire within
    30&nbsp;days, again using the existing web server to establish you as
    the owner of the&nbsp;domain. You can run this command as a cronjob.

    <br><br>

    After your certificate is renewed, you must restart your web server
    for the change to take&nbsp;effect. Alternatively, you can exchange
    certificates while the server keeps running, which is described below.

    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Exchanging certificates</h2></center>

    SWI-Prolog makes it possible to <i>exchange</i> certificates while
    the&nbsp;server <i>keeps&nbsp;running</i>.

    <br><br>

    One way to do this is as follows:

    <ol>

      <li>Start your server <i>without</i> specifying a certificate or
        key.</li>

      <li>Use the extensible predicate <tt>http:ssl_server_create_hook/3</tt> to add
        a certificate and key upon launch, while storing the original
        SSL&nbsp;context. See&nbsp;<tt>ssl_add_certificate_key/4</tt>.</li>

      <li>When necessary, renew the certificate as explained above. Use
       <tt>ssl_add_certificate_key/4</tt> to add the new certificate to the
       original SSL&nbsp;context, obtaining a new&nbsp;context that is
       associated with the updated certificate.</li>
      <li>Use the extensible predicate <tt>http:ssl_server_open_client_hook/3</tt>
        to use the new&nbsp;context when negotiating client connections.</li>
    </ol>

    See
    the <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/ssl.html%27)">SSL
      documentation</a> for more information.

    <br><br>

    Using the original context as a baseline ensures that all command
    line&nbsp;options are adhered to and copied to new contexts that are
    created. For example, any specified <i>password</i> is securely retained in
    contexts and can therefore be used also for newly created&nbsp;keys.

    <br><br>

    Note
    how <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/purity"><b>logical
    purity</b></a> of these predicates allows the thread-safe
    implementation of a feature that is not available in most other
    web&nbsp;servers.

    <center><h2>Server Name Indication (SNI)</h2></center>

    To host multiple domains from a single IP address, you need <b>Server
      Name Indication</b>&nbsp;(SNI). This TLS&nbsp;extension lets you
    indicate different certificates and keys depending on the
    <i>host&nbsp;name</i> that the client accesses.

    <br><br>

    The HTTP Unix daemon can be configured to use&nbsp;SNI by providing
    suitable clauses of the predicate&nbsp;<tt>http:sni_options/2</tt>. The first
    argument is the *host&nbsp;name*, and the second argument is a list of
    SSL&nbsp;options for that domain. The most important options&nbsp;are:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>certificate_file(+File)</tt>: file that contains the <b>certificate</b>
        and certificate&nbsp;chain</li>
      <li><tt>key_file(+File)</tt>: file that contains the <b>private key</b>.</li>
    </ul>

    For example, to specify a certificate and key for&nbsp;<tt>abc.com</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>www.abc.com</tt>, we can&nbsp;use:

    <pre>
http:sni_options('abc.com', [certificate_file(CertFile),key_file(KeyFile)]) :-
        CertFile = '/var/www/abc.com/server.crt',
        KeyFile = '/var/www/abc.com/server.key'.
http:sni_options('www.abc.com', Options) :-
        http:sni_options('abc.com', Options).
    </pre>

    <center><h2>Doing it all manually</h2></center>

    Instead of relying on the Unix daemon library, you can also _manually_
    start an HTTPS&nbsp;server via <tt>http_server/2</tt>. This gives you total
    control over all aspects of the server, including those that cannot be
    specified as command line options. The options for <tt>ssl_context/3</tt> are
    specified as&nbsp;<tt>ssl(+Options)</tt>.

    <br><br>

    For example:

    <pre>
:- use_module(library(http/thread_httpd)).
:- use_module(library(http/http_ssl_plugin)).

https_server(Port, Options) :-
        http_server(reply,
                    [ port(Port),
                      <b>ssl([ certificate_file('/var/www/xyz.com/server.crt'),
                            key_file('/var/www/xyz.com/server.key')
                          ])</b>
                    | Options
                    ]).
reply(_) :-
        format("Content-type: text/plain~n~n"),
        format("Hello!").
    </pre>

    Typical use cases do *not* require this. A better way to obtain the
    same effect is to rely on the HTTP Unix daemon library, and use the
    available hooks for more fine-grained control of SSL&nbsp;parameters.
