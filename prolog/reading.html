    <br><br>

    While you may <a href="writing"><i>write</i></a>
    a Prolog <a href="concepts#program">program</a>
    only <i>once</i>, and may even <i>rewrite</i> it a few times, you
    and others will typically <i>read</i> it many, many, many times.

    Consequently, it is important to know <i>how</i> we can best read
    Prolog programs: What exactly do they mean?

    There are several ways to
    read <a href="purity"><b>pure</b></a> Prolog programs, and we
    explain some of them in this text.

    <br><br>
    
    <center><h2 id="declarative">Declarative reading</h2></center>

    Declaratively, Prolog programs state <i>what holds</i>. A Prolog
    program consists of <b>clauses</b>, and each clause is either
    a <b>fact</b> or a <b>rule</b>. <i>Facts</i> state what is
    <i>always</i> true. <i>Rules</i> state what is true under
    certain <i>conditions</i>.

    <br><br>

    Declaratively, a rule of the form:

    <pre>
Head :- Body.
    </pre>

    is read as: "<i>If</i> <tt>Body</tt> is
    true, <i>then</i> <tt>Head</tt> is true." In logical terms, we say
    that <tt>Body</tt> <i>implies</i> <tt>Head</tt>, written
    as <tt>Body</tt>&rightarrow;<tt>Head</tt>, or equivalently as:

    <pre>
Head &leftarrow; Body.
    </pre>

    Note that <tt>:-</tt> is in fact meant to represent the arrow
    &leftarrow;. Since <tt>Body</tt> defines the conditions under
    which <tt>Head</tt>&nbsp;holds, it can also be regarded as
    a&nbsp;<i>constraint</i> on the set of solutions.

    <br><br>

    This way to read Prolog programs is also called <i>concluding</i> reading.

    <br><br>

    A major advantage of this approach is that it is easy to explain,
    understand and use. You state what holds under what conditions,
    and the Prolog engine finds solutions for you. A disadvantage of
    this approach is that it does not explain why logically equivalent
    program variants may exhibit different performance or termination
    characteristics.

    <br><br>

    <div class="example" id="list_list_together3">
      <b>Example:</b> <tt>list_list_together/3</tt>, describing
      the <i>concatenation</i> of two lists:

      <pre>
list_list_together([], Bs, Bs).
list_list_together([A|As], Bs, [A|Cs]) :-
        list_list_together(As, Bs, Cs).
      </pre>

      Let us read this definition <i>declaratively</i>, that is in
      terms of <i>relations</i> that hold between arguments, as
      described by the two clauses:

      <ol>
        <li>The concatenation of the <i>empty
            list</i>&nbsp;<tt>[]</tt> and <i>any</i>
            list&nbsp;<tt>Bs</tt> is just that
          list&nbsp;<tt>Bs</tt>.</li>
        
        <li><i>If</i> the concatenation of <tt>As</tt>
        and&nbsp;<tt>Bs</tt> is <tt>Cs</tt>, <i>then</i> the
        concatenation of <tt>[A|As]</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>Bs</tt>
        is&nbsp;<tt>[A|Cs]</tt>, for <i>any</i>
          element&nbsp;<tt>A</tt>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      Note how <i>general</i> this reading is: It is applicable if any
      arguments are <i>instantiated</i>, and <i>also</i> if they
      are&nbsp;not.
    </div>

    <center><h2 id="procedural">Procedural reading</h2></center>

    To complement the declarative approach of reading Prolog programs,
    we can also read them <i>procedurally</i>. This means that we take
    into account the actual <i>computation strategy</i> of the Prolog
    engine.

    <br><br>

    Operationally, invocation of a Prolog predicate is similar to
    a <i>procedure</i> or <i>function</i> call in other
    languages. However, two critical differences remain: First,
    Prolog <i>variables</i> are truly <b>variables</b>
    and may be <i>unbound</i> or only <i>partially</i> instantiated.
    This cannot happen with variables in most other languages. Second,
    Prolog provides <b>backtracking</b> as a built-in feature, and
    will exhaustively try alternatives.

    <br><br>

    For these reasons, understanding a Prolog
    program <i>procedurally</i> is significantly <i>harder</i> than
    understanding the control flow of many other programming
    languages. In particular, when tracing Prolog, you need to take
    into account:

    <ul>
      <li><b>instantiation</b> of variables</li>
      <li><b>aliasing</b> between variables</li>
      <li><b>alternatives</b> found on backtracking.</li>
    </ul>

    The need to keep track of these complexities and their
    interactions is a major drawback of this approach. An advantage of
    the approach is its potential to explain
    different <a href="efficiency">performance
    characteristics</a> and <a href="termination">termination
      properties</a> of program variants.

    <br><br>

    Note also that a procedural reading almost invariably implies a
    particular <i>direction</i> of&nbsp;use, and therefore typically
    does not do justice to the full generality of logical relations.

    <br><br>
    <div class="example">
      <b>Example:</b> Let us read <a href="#list_list_together3"><tt>list_list_together/3</tt></a> (shown above)
      <i>procedurally</i> for the query <tt>?-&nbsp;list_list_together([x,y], [z], Cs).</tt>

      <ol>
        
        <li>Does the <i>first</i> clause apply? <b>No</b>, because <tt>[x,y]</tt> does not unify with&nbsp;<tt>[]</tt>.</li>

        <li>Does the <i>second</i> clause apply? Note that due to the way
          resolution works, we must
          introduce <i>fresh&nbsp;variables</i> when considering a
          clause. So, let us
          use <tt>A'</tt>, <tt>As'</tt>, <tt>Bs'</tt>, and <tt>Cs'</tt>
          for the variables <tt>A</tt>, <tt>As</tt>, <tt>Bs</tt>
          and <tt>Cs</tt> that appear in the clause head. The answer is:
          <b>Yes</b>, the second clause applies with the
          bindings <tt>A'=x</tt>, <tt>As'=[y]</tt>, <tt>Bs'=[z]</tt>, <tt>Cs=[A'|Cs']</tt>.
          This is already rather cumbersome and error-prone, and it
          gets even harder to keep track of all bindings as we proceed
          further.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Carrying on, we consider the
          goal <tt>list_list_together([y], [z], Cs')</tt>, repeating the
          same questions for this goal.
        </li>

        
        <li>Does the <i>first</i> clause apply? <b>No</b>, because <tt>[y]</tt> does not unify with&nbsp;<tt>[]</tt>.</li>

        
        <li>Does the <i>second</i> clause apply? We need to rename the
          variables again. Let us
          use <tt>A''</tt>, <tt>As''</tt>, <tt>Bs''</tt>
          and&nbsp;<tt>Cs''</tt>. <b>Yes</b>, the clause applies
          with <tt>A''=y</tt>, <tt>As''=[]</tt>, <tt>Bs''=[z]</tt>
          and <tt>Cs'=[A''|Cs'']</tt>.
        </li>

        
        <li>Now the whole ordeal once more, as we consider the
          goal <tt>list_list_together([], [z], Cs'')</tt>.</li>

        <li>Does the <i>first</i> clause apply? <b>Yes</b>, at last!
          Note that we <i>again</i> need to introduce fresh variables
          of course. Let us use <tt>Bs'''</tt> to denote the single
          variable of the first clause at this step of the
          computation. So the first clause applies
          with <tt>Bs'''=[z]</tt> and <tt>Cs''=Bs'''</tt>. This means
          that at last a <i>solution</i> is found and reported as
          a <i>binding</i> for the original variable <tt>Cs</tt> which
          is the only variable that appears in the query. If you have
          carefully followed this trace (as I am sure you have, since
          it is so enjoyable to&nbsp;read), you know that <tt>Cs</tt>
          was unified with <tt>[A'|Cs']</tt>. Since
          <tt>A'</tt> was unified with&nbsp;<tt>x</tt>, and
          <tt>Cs'</tt> was unified with&nbsp;<tt>[A''|Cs'']</tt>, and
          further <tt>A''</tt> was unified with&nbsp;<tt>y</tt>, this
          makes <tt>Cs</tt> the same as <tt>[x,y|Cs'']</tt>. As we
          just mentioned, <tt>Cs''</tt> was unified
          with&nbsp;<tt>Bs'''</tt>, and <tt>Bs'''</tt>
          is&nbsp;<tt>[z]</tt>. Thus, the solution we found
          is&nbsp;<tt>Cs=[x,y,z]</tt>, and this solution is reported
          by the toplevel.
        </li>
        
        <li>We still need to consider the <i>second</i> clause
          too&nbsp;though: <b>No</b>, it does not apply,
          because <tt>[]</tt> does not unify with&nbsp;<tt>[_|_]</tt>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      And this was only <i>one particular case</i>! Accurately
      covering all possible modes of invocation with a procedural
      reading is extremely complex, and typically would take an
      extremely elaborate explanation. In general, you will not be
      able to carry this approach through, because there are too many
      cases to consider.

    <center><h2 id="slicing">Program slicing</h2></center>

    Program <b>slicing</b> is a simple and powerful technique that
    uses very general properties of pure Prolog to study the effects
    of <b>generalizations</b> and <b>specializations</b> of a program.

    <br><br>

    Examples of such properties are:

    <ul>
      <li><i>removing</i> a <b>goal</b> can make the program at
        most <i>more general</i>, never more <i>specific</i></li>
      <li><i>removing</i> a <b>clause</b> can make the program at
        most <i>more specific</i>, never more <i>general</i></li>
      <li><i>inserting</i> <tt>false/0</tt> between any two goals in a
        rule lets us ignore the procedural effects of <i>all</i>
        goals <i>after</i> that point.</li>
    </ul>

    
    In a very precise sense, program slices are <b>explanations</b>
    that answer <i>why</i> we observe certain phenomena.

    <br><br>

    We illustrate this with a simple example. Suppose a programmer has
    written <tt>list_length/2</tt>, relating a list to its length as
    follows:

    <pre>
list_length([_|Ls], N) :-
        list_length(Ls, N0),
        N #&gt; 0,
        N #= N0 + 1.
list_length([], 0).
    </pre>

    The predicate works exactly as intended if the list is sufficiently
    instantiated. For example:

    <pre>
?- list_length([], L).
<b>L = 0.</b>

?- list_length([_,_,_], L).
<b>L = 3.</b>
    </pre>

    However, the predicate does <i>not</i> generate a single answer
    for the most general query:

    <pre>
?- list_length(Ls, L).
    </pre>

    Program slicing helps us to see the reason. <s>Strikeout</s> text
    is used for parts that are not relevant for the behaviour we
    observe:

    <pre>
list_length([_|Ls], N) :-
        list_length(Ls, N0),
        <b>false</b>,
        <s>N #&gt; 0</s>,
        <s>N #= N0 + 1</s>.
<s>list_length([], 0) :- <b>false</b>.</s>
    </pre>

    The remaining fragment is <i>by itself</i> already responsible for
    the <a href="nontermination"><b>nontermination</b></a>. <i>No</i> change
    in the <s>strikeout</s> parts can prevent&nbsp;it.

    <br><br>

    Program slices can be generated <i>automatically</i> and are a
    powerful way to <a href="debugging">locate the causes</a> of
    nontermination and other unintended properties in Prolog programs.
    See for example Stefan Kral et&nbsp;al., <i>Slicing zur
    Fehlersuche in Logikprogrammen</i>, WLP&nbsp;2000.
