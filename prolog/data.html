    <center><h1>Prolog Data Structures</h1></center>
    <br><br>

    <center><h2 id="term">Terms</h2></center>

    In Prolog, all data is represented by Prolog <b>terms</b>.

    <br><br>

    Terms are defined inductively:

    <ul>
      <li>an <b>atom</b> is a term. Examples of atoms
        are: <tt>x</tt>, <tt>test</tt> and <tt>'quotes and space'</tt>.</li>

      <li> a <b>variable</b> is a term. Variables start with an
        uppercase letter or underscore&nbsp;<tt>_</tt>. A single
        underscore denotes an <i>anonymous&nbsp;variables</i> and can
        be read as "any&nbsp;term".</li>

      <li><b>integers</b> and <b>floating point numbers</b> are terms.
        Examples: 42 and 42.42. </li>

      <li>a <b>compound term</b> is a term, defined inductively as
        follows: <i>If</i> <tt>T<sub>1</sub></tt>, <tt>T<sub>2</sub></tt>,
        ..., <tt>T<sub>n</sub></tt> are
        terms, <i>then</i> <i>F</i>(<tt>T<sub>1</sub></tt>, <tt>T<sub>2</sub></tt>, ..., <tt>T<sub>n</sub></tt>)
        is also a term, where <i>F</i> is called the <i>functor</i> of the
        compound term, and <tt>n</tt> is called the <i>arity</i>. Examples: <tt>f(a)</tt>, <tt>g(f(X))</tt> and <tt>+(a, f(X))</tt>.</li>
    </ul>

    All data can be represented in this way. Terms come into existence
    by simply writing them&nbsp;down.

    <br><br>

    Prolog is <i>dynamically typed</i> and allows us great freedom for
    representing data. For example, we <i>could</i> represent natural
    numbers as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>we <i>could</i> use the atom <tt>zero</tt> to represent&nbsp;0</li>
      <li>we <i>could</i> use the compound term <tt>s(X)</tt> to
        represent the successor of&nbsp;<tt>X</tt>.</li>
    </ul>

    In this representation, the term <tt>s(s(s(zero)))</tt> represents
    the number&nbsp;3. Such a representation is of course highly
    impractical due to its enormous size for large&nbsp;numbers. For
    this reason, Prolog provides <a href="clpfd">integer
      arithmetic</a> with a much more efficient number representation.

    <br><br>

    Prolog terms naturally correspond
    to&nbsp;<a href="optimization#tree">trees</a>. There is a
    <a href="sorting#order">standard&nbsp;order</a> on&nbsp;terms.

    <center><h2 id="list">Lists</h2></center>

    Prolog <b>lists</b> are a special case of <a href="#term"><i>terms</i></a>.
    <br><br>
    Lists are defined inductively:

    <ul>
      <li>the atom <tt>[]</tt> is a list, denoting the <i>empty list</i></li>
      <li><i>if</i> <tt>Ls</tt> is a list, <i>then</i> the term <tt>'.'(L,
          Ls)</tt> is <i>also</i> a list.</li>
    </ul>

    There is a special syntax for denoting lists conveniently in Prolog:

    <ol>
      <li>The list <tt>'.'(a, '.'(b, '.'(c, [])))</tt> can also be
        written as <tt>[a,b,c]</tt>.</li>

      <li>The term <tt>'.'(L, Ls)</tt> can also be written as <tt>[L|Ls]</tt>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    These notations can be combined in any way. For example, the term
    <tt>[a,b|Ls]</tt> is a list <i>iff</i> <tt>Ls</tt> is a list.

    <br><br>

    Lists naturally represent <i>collections</i> of elements and arise
    in almost all Prolog&nbsp;programs. When choosing between lists
    and any other way to represent collections of elements, ask
    yourself the following questions:

    <ul>
      <li>Can there be <i>arbitrarily many</i> elements?</li>
      <li>Can there be <i>zero</i> elements?</li>
      <li>Is the <i>order</i> of elements significant?</li>
      <li>Are the elements of the same <i>kind</i>?</li>
    </ul>

    If your answer is "yes" to most of these questions, lists are
    often a good&nbsp;fit.

    <br><br>

    In contrast, consider for example the case where each collection
    comprises exactly three elements. You can use lists of the
    form <tt>[A,B,C]</tt> to represent such collections, and thus
    benefit from <a href="metapredicates">meta-predicates</a> that
    reason over&nbsp;lists. On the other hand, using compound terms of
    the form <tt>f(A,B,C)</tt> is more memory efficient: This is
    because the list <tt>[A,B,C]</tt> is the compound
    term <tt>'.'(A,'.'(B,'.'(C,[])))</tt> and thus takes
    roughly <i>twice</i> the space of the term <tt>f(A,B,C)</tt>
    in&nbsp;memory.

    <br><br>

    <a href="dcg">DCG notation</a> is frequently used for
    describing&nbsp;lists.

    <center><h2 id="pair">Pairs</h2></center>

    By convention, the functor <tt>(-)/2</tt> is often used to denote
    <i>pairs</i> of elements in Prolog. For example, the term <tt>-(A,
    B)</tt> denotes the pair of elements <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>. In
    Prolog, <tt>(-)/2</tt> is defined as an infix <i>operator</i>.
    Therefore, the term can be written equivalently
    as&nbsp;<tt>A-B</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Many commonly available predicates also use this syntax to denote
    pairs. Examples of this
    are <a href="sorting#keysort"><tt>keysort/2</tt></a>
    and <tt>pairs_keys_values/3</tt>.

    <center><h2 id="assoc">Association lists</h2></center>

    In many Prolog systems, <b>association lists</b> are available to
    allow faster than linear access to a collection of elements. These
    association lists are typically based on balanced trees
    like <b>AVL</b>&nbsp;trees.

    <br><br>

    There is a public domain library called <tt>library(assoc)</tt>
    that ships with many Prolog systems and provides operations for
    inserting, fetching and changing elements of a collection.

    <br><br>

    Here is one way to represent an AVL&nbsp;tree in Prolog:

    <ol>
      <li>the <i>empty</i> tree is represented by the
        atom&nbsp;<tt>t</tt>.</li>
      <li>an <i>inner&nbsp;node</i> is represented as
        a <i>compound&nbsp;term</i> of the form <tt>t(Key, Value,
          Balance, Left, Right)</tt> where:

        <ul>
          <li><tt>Key</tt> and <tt>Value</tt> represent
            the <i>association</i> of&nbsp;<tt>Key</tt>
            with&nbsp;<tt>Value</tt>.</li>
          <li><tt>Balance</tt> is an <i>atom</i> that denotes a
          balance criterion, such as a relation between the number of
          children of the left and right subtrees. For example, we can
          use the atoms <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>=</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> to
            denote different states between the subtrees.
          </li>

          <li><tt>Left</tt> and <tt>Right</tt> are AVL&nbsp;trees.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    Every operation on AVL&nbsp;trees, such as adding or changing an
    association, can be described as a <i>relation</i> between
    different trees, one tree <i>before</i> the operation and
    one <i>after</i>&nbsp;it. See <a href="/tist/"><i>Thinking
        in&nbsp;States</i></a> for more information.

    <br><br>

    AVL&nbsp;trees let us perform many important operations
    in <i>O</i>(log(<i>N</i>))&nbsp;time, where <i>N</i> is the number
    of associations. This is acceptably efficient in many&nbsp;cases.


    <center><h2 id="string">Strings?</h2></center>

    Almost everything that needs to be said about <i>strings</i> has
    been brilliantly said by Richard O'Keefe in
    his <a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/ok/pllib.htm">Prolog
    Library Proposal</a>. In particular, <b>strings
    are&nbsp;wrong</b>, and:

    <blockquote>
      For almost any use case that involves some kind of processing,
      the only sensible thing to do with string data is to turn it
      into some kind of tree <i>early</i>. Prolog is brilliant with
      trees.
    </blockquote>

    In Prolog, a convenient representation of strings is available as
    lists of <i>characters</i>, which are <i>atoms</i>. This
    representation is available if you add the following directive to
    your program:
    <br><br>
    <pre class="box">
<b>:- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, chars).</b></pre>

    <br><br>
    With this setting, we obtain for example:

    <pre>
?- Cs = "test".
<b>Cs = [t, e, s, t]</b>.
    </pre>

    Thus, working with strings is reduced to working
    with&nbsp;<a href="#list">lists</a>, which can be easily handled
    in&nbsp;Prolog.


    <center><h2>Arrays?</h2></center>

    What about <b>arrays</b>? Is there any data structure in Prolog to
    represent a collection of terms, allowing
    for <i>O(1)</i>&nbsp;access to individual elements?

    <br><br>

    First of all, the concept of <i>destructive</i> modifications is
    alien to logic programming. In Prolog, we
    describe <i>relations</i> between entities, not destructive
    effects. To express a change in a Prolog data structure, we define
    a predicate that relates the state of the structure <i>before</i>
    the change to a different structure <i>after</i> the change. For
    this reason, <a href="purity"><b>pure</b></a> modifications
    often entail some <i>copying</i> of data and typically lead to at
    least logarithmic overhead (for example, to copy a subtree of a
    balanced tree).

    <br><br>

    That being said, we can access the <i>arguments</i> of a term
    in <i>O(1)</i> with the built-in predicate <tt>arg/3</tt>. There
    even is an impure predicate called <tt>setarg/3</tt> which allows
    destructive modifications to a term. Use it at your own peril: If
    you use <tt>setarg/3</tt>, you can no longer reason about your
    code in the way you expect from pure relations. If you really need
    efficient destructive modifications of terms, it is better to
    use <a href="attributedvariables">attributed&nbsp;variables</a>.

    <center><h2 id="clean">Clean vs. defaulty representations</h2></center>

    When representing data with Prolog terms, ask yourself the following question:

    <blockquote>
      Can I <i>distinguish the kind</i> of each component from
      its <i>outermost functor and arity</i>?
    </blockquote>

    If this holds, your representation is called <b>clean</b>. If
    you <i>cannot</i> distinguish the elements by their outermost
    functor and arity, your representation is
    called&nbsp;<b>defaulty</b>, a wordplay combining "default"
    and&nbsp;"faulty". This is because <i>reasoning</i> about your
    data will need a "<i>default&nbsp;case</i>", which is applied if
    everything else fails. In addition, such a representation prevents
    argument indexing, and is considered
    <i>faulty</i> due to this shortcoming. Always aim to <i>avoid</i>
    defaulty representations! Aim for cleaner representations instead.

    <br><br>

    For example, suppose you represent a <b>full binary tree</b> in
    Prolog. There are two <i>kinds</i> of elements in a full binary
    tree:

    <ul>
      <li><b>leaves</b>, which are concrete elements of the tree</li>
      <li><b>nodes</b>, which have two children that are again full
      binary trees.</li>
    </ul>

    We can represent such trees with Prolog terms as follows:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>leaf(L)</tt> represents the <i>leaf</i> <tt>L</tt></li>
      <li><tt>node(Left, Right)</tt> represents a <i>node</i> and its
        two&nbsp;children.</li>
    </ul>

    The above is a <b>clean</b> representation: It lets us distinguish
    the kinds of elements by their outermost functor. We can reason
    about such trees in a way that keeps the code very general and
    usable in all directions. Such a representation is also amenable
    to <a href="efficiency#indexing">argument&nbsp;indexing</a>.

    <br><br>

    You can also recognize a clean representation if it lets you
    describe the general <i>structure</i> of your data while retaining
    enough flexibility to keep the concrete elements unspecified. For
    example, in the case of full binary trees, we can represent the
    general outline of all trees with exactly <i>two leaves</i>
    as <tt>node(leaf(_),leaf(_))</tt>. If you had chosen
    to <i>omit</i> the <tt>leaf/1</tt> wrapper for representing
    leaves, this would become <tt>node(_,_)</tt>: a <i>defaulty</i>
    representation that no longer represents precisely such
    manifestations.

    <br><br>

    Sometimes, it will appear to you that there is no clean way out.
    For instance, you may be faced with a representation
    that <i>requires</i> you to distinguish different cases in an
    impure and non-monotonic way, such as by testing
    the <i>instantiation</i> of certain arguments
    via&nbsp;<tt>var/1</tt>. In such cases, it is good practice to
    restrict the impure parts of your program to small fragments, and
    to <i>convert</i> any defaulty representation to a clean&nbsp;one
    by introducing suitable wrappers that let you distinguish the
    cases by pattern&nbsp;matching. This helps to ensure that you can
    use your core predicates in multiple directions.

    <center><h2>Term inspection</h2></center>

    In Prolog, the most natural way to reason about&nbsp;terms is to
    rely on <i>unification</i>. In addition, there are several
    predicates that let you decompose and analyze&nbsp;terms. The most
    important of these <b>term&nbsp;inspection</b> predicates
    are <tt>functor/3</tt>, <tt>arg/3</tt> and <tt>(=..)/2</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Here are examples that illustrate their usage:

    <pre>
<b>?- functor(f(a,g(X)), Functor, Arity).</b>
Functor = f,
Arity = 2.

<b>?- functor(Term, f, 2).</b>
Term = f(_25002, _25004).

<b>?- arg(2, f(a,g(X)), Arg).</b>
Arg = g(X).

<b>?- f(a,g(X)) =.. [Functor|Args].</b>
Functor = f,
Args = [a, g(X)].

<b>?- Term =.. [f,a,g(X)].</b>
Term = f(a, g(X)).
    </pre>

    These predicates cannot be defined by a finite set of clauses, and
    can therefore be considered <a href="metapredicates">higher-order
    predicates</a>. Do not get carried away with these predicates!
    Everything that <i>can</i> be expressed by
    pattern&nbsp;matching <i>should</i> be expressed by
    pattern&nbsp;matching. For example, instead of <tt>functor(Term,
    f, 2)</tt>, you can simply write <tt>Term = f(_,_)</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Every Prolog term has a <b>canonical</b> representation. If you
    are ever unsure about the structure of a&nbsp;term,
    use <tt>write_canonical/1</tt> to obtain the canonical
    representation. For example:

    <pre>
?- write_canonical(a+b=[x,y,z]).
<b>=(+(a,b),'.'(x,'.'(y,'.'(z,[]))))</b>
    </pre>

    The canonical representation shows the structure of the&nbsp;term
    in such a way that it can also be easily parsed by
    external&nbsp;programs.
