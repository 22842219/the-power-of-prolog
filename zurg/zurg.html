      <h2>Motivation</h2>
    </center>

    There is a <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/Zurg_JFP04.pdf">paper</a> that asks for a solution to the following problem:

    <blockquote class="box">

       Buzz, Woody, Rex, and Hamm have to escape from Zurg. They
       merely have to cross one last bridge before they are free.
       However, the bridge is fragile and can hold at most two of them
       at the same time. Moreover, to cross the bridge a flashlight is
       needed to avoid traps and broken parts. The problem is that our
       friends have only one flashlight with one battery that lasts
       for only 60 minutes. The toys need different times to cross the
       bridge (in either direction):
       <br><br>

       <center>
         <table>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Toy</b></td>
          <td><b><center>Time</center></b></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><hr></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Buzz</td>
          <td style="text-align:right">5</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Woody&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
          <td style="text-align:right">10</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Rex</td>
          <td style="text-align:right">20</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Hamm</td>
          <td style="text-align:right">25</td>
        </tr>
       </table>
       </center>
       <br><br>

       Since there can be only two toys on the bridge at the same
       time, they cannot cross the bridge all at once. Since they need
       the flashlight to cross the bridge, whenever two have crossed
       the bridge, somebody has to go back and bring the flashlight to
       those toys on the other side that still have to cross the
       bridge. The problem now is: In which order can the four toys
       cross the bridge in time (that is, within 60 minutes) to be
       saved from Zurg?

    The approach taken by the paper follows a long tradition: First, a
    convoluted Prolog solution is presented, and this is then compared
    with a more elegant solution in a different language. The point of
    this page is to show you that there is also an
    elegant <i>Prolog&nbsp;solution</i> for this task.
    <br><br>

    <center>
      <h2>Prolog solution</h2>
    </center>

    To represent the <i>state</i> of the world in this problem, we will
    use a term of the form <tt>state(T,Ls,Rs)</tt>, where:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>T</tt> is an integer that denotes the time taken so far</li>

      <li><tt>Ls</tt> is a list of toys that are on the left side</li>

      <li><tt>Rs</tt> is a list of toys that are on the right side</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    Without loss of generality, let us suppose that all toys are
    initially on the <i>left</i> side, and need to cross the bridge to
    get to the <i>right</i> side. Clearly, two important states are
    hence:

    <ul>

      <li>the <i>initial state</i>, which we can represent
        as <tt>state(0,[buzz,woody,rex,hamm],[])</tt> in our representation</li>


      <li>the desired <i>final state</i>, where all toys are on the
      right side, or equivalently, none of the toys are on the left
      side, and which we can hence represent
        as&nbsp;<tt>state(_,[],_)</tt>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    We are looking for a sequence of <i>state transitions</i>
    or <i>moves</i> that take us from the initial state to the desired
    final state. For convenience, we are using a
    Prolog <a href="/prolog/dcg"><b>Definite Clause
    Grammar&nbsp;(DCG)</b></a> to describe such sequences
    of&nbsp;moves.

    <br><br>

    We distinguish between two <i>kinds</i> of moves:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>left_to_right(Toy1,Toy2)</tt> means that <tt>Toy1</tt> and <tt>Toy2</tt> move from left to right</li>

      <li><tt>right_to_left(Toy)</tt> means that <tt>Toy</tt> moves
      from right to left</li>
    </ul>

    It follows from the from task description that no other kinds of
    moves are necessary.<br><br>

    An important precondition for each such move is that we stay
    within the time limit of 60&nbsp;minutes.

    <br><br>

    Using these features, here is a Prolog solution for this puzzle:
    <br><br>

    <pre>
toy_time(buzz,   5).
toy_time(woody, 10).
toy_time(rex,   20).
toy_time(hamm,  25).

moves(Ms) :- phrase(moves(state(0,[buzz,woody,rex,hamm],[])), Ms).

moves(state(T0,Ls0,Rs0)) --&gt;
        { select(Toy1, Ls0, Ls1), select(Toy2, Ls1, Ls2),
          Toy1 @< Toy2,
          toy_time(Toy1, Time1), toy_time(Toy2, Time2),
          T1 #= T0 + max(Time1,Time2), T1 #=< 60 },
        [left_to_right(Toy1,Toy2)],
        moves_(state(T1,Ls2,[Toy1,Toy2|Rs0])).

moves_(state(_,[],_))     --&gt; [].
moves_(state(T0,Ls0,Rs0)) --&gt;
        { select(Toy, Rs0, Rs1),
          toy_time(Toy, Time),
          T1 #= T0 + Time, T1 #=< 60 },
        [right_to_left(Toy)],
        moves(state(T1,[Toy|Ls0],Rs1)).
    </pre>

    Note that only 4 predicates (instead of 8) are necessary.
    <br>
    <br>
    Example interaction, using GNU Prolog 1.3.0:

    <pre>
| ?- moves(Ms).

Ms = [left_to_right(buzz,woody),right_to_left(buzz),left_to_right(hamm,rex),right_to_left(woody),left_to_right(buzz,woody)] ? ;

Ms = [left_to_right(buzz,woody),right_to_left(woody),left_to_right(hamm,rex),right_to_left(buzz),left_to_right(buzz,woody)] ? ;

no
    </pre>
